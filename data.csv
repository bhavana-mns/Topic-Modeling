"It begins as the psychological process by which a child learns to fill the gaps between knowledge, reality and experience, and becomes a vital adult coping mechanism.

When we were small children, trying to get to sleep, a creaking floorboard was really spooky. Who or what could be making the noise? The only way to make sense of the experience, for which there was no ""certain""answer, was to fantasise: there's a pirate or a burglar, or more probably a crocodile under the bed.

Children scare themselves silly like this, but while they have no knowledge of central heating pipes swelling, they have to engage with make-believe to bridge the gap between experience and knowledge. As time passes and children learn about the effect of heat on pipes and floorboard, they will often prefer the crocodile theory. Fear, within a safe context, is fun.

Children are born with the full spectrum of human emotions, wild, exciting, passionate, vigorous, totally irrational and raring to go. But they are also inexperienced and longing to explore their feelings. This is why they need to be scared and fantasy is an excellent, ""safe"" way to do it - going out to find real crocodiles to play with is neither practical nor safe.",2,,,
" The first mission designed to hunt a meteorite that crashed into the ocean has now discovered what may be tiny fragments of the meteorite's crust, researchers say.

On March 7, three National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather stations detected the fall of a meteorite about 15.5 miles (25 kilometers) off the coast of Washington state. ""The fall was widely seen around local areas and widely heard around local areas — it came with some loud sonic booms,"" Marc Fries, the cosmic dust curator for NASA, told Live Science.

Fries estimated this fall might yield about 4,400 lbs. (2,000 kilograms) of meteorites. He also calculated the largest meteorite might weigh about 9.7 lbs. (4.4 kg) and have a diameter of about 5 inches (12 centimeters). [Crash! The 10 Biggest Impact Craters on Earth]",3,,,
"Christmas tries to claim the title all for itself, but we all know fantasy football draft season is truly the best time of the year. We are not far along quite yet, but draft season is underway and that means we’ve got to start talking about everyone’s favorite topic: sleepers. Now, it seems everyone has something different in mind when we they hear sleepers, so before we jump into 10 that I love for 2018 drafts, let me first give my definition so you know just what I mean when I call these 10 sleepers.

    They’ve got to have an ADP outside the top 150 (100 usually, but today I’m sharing deep sleepers)
        You can’t proclaim Sony Michel as a sleeper just because he hasn’t done it before.
        You can’t proclaim Pierre Garcon as a sleeper just because your buddy might not know much about him
        You can’t proclaim Greg Olsen as a sleeper just because he was injured last year
    It can’t be someone everyone is talking about and will thus see their ADP soar shortly ",2,,,
"The recent heat around the world is naturally coinciding with the simple fact that we’re moving closer to football season. Or at least we can pretend that’s the reason. Weather aside, we are in fact inching toward August and before you know it, you’ll be drafting a fantasy team and replaying each pick in your head afterward. All you can hope for at that point is that you end up drafting 2018’s version of Alvin Kamara or Carson Wentz (pre-injury of course) from last season.

The goal of every draft should be to pick guys who are going to score you the most points. Easy enough, right? Often times, that will come from the first couple of rounds, but like those names above, there’s value to be had with every pick. You should always go into a draft with a game plan and a solid set of rankings. Part of that includes a list of players you really want to target. To help with figuring out who those players might be, we asked nine experts across the fantasy industry to tell us which one guy they’re hoping to roster in all of their leagues. See their answers below.",2,,,
"T cell engineering breakthrough sidesteps need for viruses in gene-editing
With faster, cheaper, more precise technique, authors say it's 'off to the races' toward new cell therapies

    University of California - San Francisco
Summary:
    In an achievement that has significant implications for research, medicine, and industry, scientists have genetically reprogrammed the human immune cells known as T cells without using viruses to insert DNA. The researchers said they expect their technique -- a rapid, versatile, and economical approach employing CRISPR gene-editing technology -- to be widely adopted in the burgeoning field of cell therapy, accelerating the development of new and safer treatments for cancer, autoimmunity, and other diseases, including rare inherited disorders.

"Polling is still best predictor of election outcomes, study suggests
Research found use of polling data effective even in developing countries

Summary:
    Donald Trump's surprising election as president of the United States was viewed by some people as evidence that electoral polling no longer works, but researchers report they have developed models using global polling data that can correctly predict up to 90 percent of election outcomes around the world. ",0,,,
"The model was developed using an election dataset covering more than 500 elections in 86 countries, along with a separate dataset that incorporated polling data from 146 elections. In addition to Kennedy, authors on the paper were Stefan Wojcik and David Lazer, both affiliated with the Lazer Lab at Northeastern University and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University.

They discovered that economic growth had little impact on election outcomes. ""Although there is a long literature on the effect of economic growth in elections, we found little to suggest a global rule, with only minor impacts for inflation observed,"" they wrote. ""Less democratic institutions, unsurprisingly, tended to favor the incumbent party.""

Kennedy said open democratic elections and whether one candidate was an incumbent improved the likelihood of accurate predictions. ""The person who holds the seat is able to use their power and name recognition to win subsequent elections.""

But, he said the most valuable predictor proved to be polling results, something that proved true across the globe.

""People normally wouldn't find this surprising. but given the recent (U.S. presidential) election, now it does seem surprising,"" he said. ""Where there was a poll, it was reasonably good at predicting outcomes, even in places you wouldn't think you'd be able to have accurate polling.""

Polling techniques used for decades in the United States also are successful in countries without a history of effective polling, Kennedy said.",0,,,
"Compared to baseline and to the inactive lighting condition, the lighting intervention significantly decreased sleep disturbances, depression and agitation. While all measures improved, the most significant improvement was seen in sleep quality.

""Here we show that if the stimulus (light dose) is carefully delivered and measured, it can have a strong impact on sleep, depression and agitation,"" said principal investigator and lead author Mariana Figueiro, PhD, a professor and director at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. ""Depression was a secondary measure, and I was pleasantly surprised by the positive impact of the light treatment on depression scores.""

The study involved 43 subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias who were exposed to an active and inactive tailored lighting intervention for successive 4-week periods, spaced by a 4-week washout period. The lighting intervention was added to spaces in which patients spent most of their waking hours and was energized from wake time until 6 p.m. Calibrated personal light meters monitored exposures. Measures of sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), mood (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia) and agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index) were collected at baseline and during the last week of the intervention.

The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented Tuesday, June 5, in Baltimore at SLEEP 2018, the 32nd annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies LLC (APSS), which is a joint venture of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.",1,,,
